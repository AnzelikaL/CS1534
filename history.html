            Archaeological findings in the Riga area indicate that a settlement existed as early as the 12th century. A natural expansion occurred where the Rīdziņa River met the Daugava River, now known as Albert’s Square, and was referred to as Riga Lake. This location was ideal for a harbor, with nearby settlements of local tribes, including the Cours and the Livonians.

            At the end of the 12th century, crusaders arrived when German merchants sought to expand and strengthen their influence along the eastern Baltic Sea coast. Their first leader, Bishop Berthold, was killed in 1198 near the Riga Old Mountain. The chronicler Indriķis mentioned the word “Riga” for the first time in written records. In 1201, Bishop Albert, after moving from Ikšķile to Riga, began negotiations with the local Livs and started building a fortification near Riga Lake. This marks 1201 as the official founding year of Riga. By 1202, the first German colonists, landowners, had settled there. Gradually, Riga became a base for aggression against the local Baltic tribes. In the 13th century, trade flourished, and Riga emerged as a key intermediary between the West and the East.

            Even by the end of the 16th century, disputes over governmental authority persisted among the residents of Riga, including the bishops, the Knights of the Sword (later known as the Livonian Order), and the landowners of Riga. At times, these disagreements escalated into armed conflicts.

            As a result of the Livonian War (1558-1583) and the subsequent collapse of the Livonian state, Riga came under Polish control. Later, during Poland’s war with Sweden (1600-1629), Riga fell to Swedish rule in 1621 after fierce resistance and became the administrative center of Sweden's Baltic territories. The 18th century began with the Northern War (1700-1721), where Russia and Sweden fought for dominance in the Baltic Sea. Following a long siege and plague epidemic, Riga was captured by Russia in 1710.

            Industry in Riga grew rapidly during the second half of the 18th century, and German guilds lost their manufacturing and trade monopoly. In the 19th century, Riga became one of the main seaports of the Russian Empire and a key railway hub. By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the city’s size expanded tenfold, and by 1913, its population was 80 times larger than it had been at the start of the 18th century. Riga was the second-largest city in western Russia, after St. Petersburg.

            From 1915-1917, Riga became a frontline city during World War I, and about 200,000 workers and their families, along with industrial enterprises, were evacuated to central Russia.

            After the end of World War I, the opportunity arose for an independent Latvian Republic, which was declared on November 18, 1918, despite a complex political situation. The Latvian War of Independence broke out, and Riga endured significant hardship, experiencing three changes in political regimes from 1918-1919. After August 1920, Riga, though devastated, became the capital of the newly independent Republic of Latvia. Between 1920 and 1930, the city transformed into a center for trade, light and food industries, and an important cultural and educational hub.

            Soviet tanks entered the streets of Riga on June 17, 1940, marking the occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union. During World War II, Riga’s Old Town suffered greatly, with its port and railway junctions destroyed. After the war, Riga became one of the largest centers in the western part of the Soviet Union. As part of industrialization plans, both light industry and major military enterprises were developed, and Riga became the hub of the Baltic military district. To staff the newly established industries, there was large-scale immigration from other Soviet republics. As a result, the population of Riga grew sevenfold between 1950 and 1980.

            When Latvia began to regain its sovereignty, Riga became the focal point of the Awakening Movement. In January 1991, the people of Latvia gathered on barricades in Riga to resist a potential attack from Soviet military forces.

            Riga’s history, spanning over 800 years, is a testament to the city’s resilience. It has weathered periods of prosperity and hardship, rising again after war, famine, and disaster, and regaining its pride each time.
