The reason I went for such website layout as I had a look at many other websites which advertise different cities and coutnries and this is usually the layout they go for. 
I added a footer to my website as otherwise it looked quite plain at the bottom and weird, as the text would finish and that is it. 
The navigation across the website which I opted in for seems to me the most logical for this laoyout and easily visible for the person using the website which makes it convenient for the user.
